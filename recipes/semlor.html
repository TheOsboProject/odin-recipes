    <p>
      This delicious swedish pastry was created during the Middle Ages. It is a
      sweet brioche bun filled with almond and carmadom paste and topped with
      whipped cream. Semlor, also called <em>semla</em> was meant to be eaten on
      Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday) in Sweden. Fettisdagen is the day before Ash
      Wednesday and is meant to be a feast before Lent. It originally consisted
      of bread soaked in a warm bowl of milk. Nowadays, swedish bakeries sell
      semlor a few months out of the year but some still only eat it on the
      <em>official</em> day.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Buns</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crumble the yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl if
        you’re working by hand. Stir in a little bit of the cold milk until the
        yeast has dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rest of the milk, sugar, freshly ground cardamom and egg and
        stir. Combine flour and baking powder in a medium bowl. Add about half
        of the flour & baking powder mix to the dough, then stir until the dough
        just comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the salt, the remaining flour mix and the butter. Work the dough
        using the dough hook on a stand mixer, for 10-15 minutes or until the
        dough is very soft and elastic. The dough will be a little sticky but
        don’t be tempted to add more flour! Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel
        and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a floured surface, divide the dough into 9 equally sized pieces.
        Using your hands (which should also be floured), shape each piece of
        dough into a ball using a circling motion until the bun is smooth and
        shiny. Cup your hand around the bun without too much pressure and swirl
        it around in a circling motion to shape it into a round and smooth ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently transfer the buns to a baking sheet with baking paper, and
        remember to leave some space between them so they can rise. Cover the
        buns with a clean kitchen towel and leave to rise for 60-90 minutes.
        Meanwhile, go through the next steps to prepare the almond filling.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Almond Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 200°C (390°F). Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and
        toast in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine almonds, sugar, salt, milk and cardamom if desired, in a food
        processor/mixer. Pulse until everything comes together, the mixture
        should be quite runny but with a slightly chunky texture from the
        almonds. Place the almond filling in the fridge while going through the
        next steps.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Baking & Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Increase the oven temperature to 225°C (435°F). Whisk together the egg,
        water and salt in a small bowl. Gently brush the buns with the egg wash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the buns for 11-13 minutes or until golden brown in color. Let cool
        on a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the tops of the buns to create a lid using a serrated knife, and
        make a small well in the middle of the bun using a fork. Save the crumb
        from the buns and add to the almond paste. Add a splash of milk to the
        almond filling if it gets too thick in consistency. Spoon the almond
        filling into the well in each bun.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, beat the cream to soft peaks.</li>
      <li>
        Pipe the cream onto each bun and place the ‘lid’ on top. Dust with
        powdered sugar. Best eaten the same day they are made.
